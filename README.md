# task1

## 2. Development Task 1

* Open Visual Studio
* The solution is in Task2\Task2.sln
* Create a new database called Books with a new login and set the connection string in appsettings.Development.json
* When the Task2 project runs dor the for time, it should create the db.
* I created a Blazor Server app using the Visual Studio template and I have added a Menu Item called Book Search, which Searches a book by Author, Title or ISBN. Also you can Add/Update a Book.
* I only wanted to show the functionality, so the design is not looking vedry good.
* To run the Unit Tests, go to the Test Explorer, click on Run All Tests.
